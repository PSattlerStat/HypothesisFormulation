# Hypothesis Formulation
This repository contains R code and supporting functions for the paper:

**"Choice of the hypothesis matrix for using the ANOVA-type statistic"** by Paavo Sattler and Manuel Rosenbaum
 (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spl.2025.110356>)


## Contents
- R function `MSroot` to calculate the matrix square root of a positive semidefinite matrix.
- R function `MSrootcompact` to calculate the compact root of a positive semidefinite matrix to transform the hypothesis matrix without changing the value of the ATS (Anova-type-statistic).
- R function `CompanionHypothesis`, which for a given linear null hypothesis (specified through hypothesis matrix **H** and corresponding vector **y**) returns the hypothesis matrix **L** and corresponding **ytilde**. These formulate the same hypothesis as the initial ones and also result in the same value of the ATS but have a minimal number of rows. 
- R function `ZhangHypothesis`, which for a given linear null hypothesis (specified through hypothesis matrix **H** and corresponding vector **y**) returns the hypothesis **G** and corresponding **yGtilde**, based on the work of Zhang et al. (2017)

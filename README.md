## Contents
- R function MSroot to calculating the matrix square root of a positiv semidefinit matrix.
- R function MSrootcompact to calculating the compact root of a positiv semidefinit matrix to transform the hypothesismatrix without changing the value of the ATS (Anova-type-statistic).
- R function CompanionHypothesis which for a given linear nullhypothesis (specified throug hypothesis matrix H and corresponding vector y) returns the hypothesis matrix L and corresponding ytilde. These formulate the same hypothesis as the initial ones, and also result in the same value of the ATS, but have a minimal number of rows. 
- R function ZhangHypothesis which for a given linear nullhypothesis (specified throug hypothesis matrix H and corresponding vector y) returns the hypothesis G and corresponding yGtilde. based on the work of Zhang et al. (2017)
